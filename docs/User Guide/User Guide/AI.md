# AI
Starting with version v0.102.0, AI/LLM integration has been removed from the Trilium Notes core.

While a significant amount of effort went into developing this feature, maintaining and supporting it long-term proved to be unsustainable.

When upgrading to v0.102.0, your Chat notes will be preserved, but instead of the dedicated chat window they will be turned to a normal <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Code.md">Code</a> note, revealing the underlying JSON of the conversation.

## Alternative solutions (MCP)

Given the recent advancements of the AI scene, MCP has grown to be more powerful and facilitates easier integrations with various application.

As such, there are third-party solutions that integrate an MCP server that can be used with Trilium:
