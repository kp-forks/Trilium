The _Collection Properties_ is a toolbar that is displayed at the top of every [collection note](../Collections.md).

For versions prior to v0.102.0, this feature was only available for the <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/New%20Layout.md">New Layout</a>. Starting with this version, the collection properties are enabled for the Old layout as well, and <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Ribbon.md">Ribbon</a> no longer contains a dedicated tab for collection properties.

The collection properties has:

*   A quick selector for the view type (e.g. grid, calendar, board).
*   A settings button with:
    *   Settings for the current view, for example hiding the weekends in a calendar.
    *   Generic settings for the collection, such as [hiding the child notes](../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree/Hiding%20the%20subtree.md) or showing [archived notes](../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Notes/Archived%20Notes.md).
*   Specific interactions for the current view, for example month selector and view switcher for the calendar.
