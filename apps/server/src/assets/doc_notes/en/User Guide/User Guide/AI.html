<p>Starting with version v0.102.0, AI/LLM integration has been removed from
  the Trilium Notes core.</p>
<p>While a significant amount of effort went into developing this feature,
  maintaining and supporting it long-term proved to be unsustainable.</p>
<p>When upgrading to v0.102.0, your Chat notes will be preserved, but instead
  of the dedicated chat window they will be turned to a normal&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"

<h2>Alternative solutions (MCP)</h2>
<p>Given the recent advancements of the AI scene, MCP has grown to be more
  powerful and facilitates easier integrations with various application.</p>
<p>As such, there are third-party solutions that integrate an MCP server
  that can be used with Trilium:</p>
<ul>
