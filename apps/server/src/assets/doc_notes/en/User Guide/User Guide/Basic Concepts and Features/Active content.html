<p><em>Active content</em> is a generic name for powerful features in Trilium,
  these range from customizing the UI to advanced scripting that can alter
  your notes or even your PC.</p>
<h2>Safe import</h2>
<p>Active content problem of safety, especially when this active content
  comes from a third-party such as if it is downloaded from a website and
  then imported into Trilium.</p>
<p>When <a href="#root/_help_mHbBMPDPkVV5">importing</a> .zip archives into Trilium, <em>safe mode</em> is
  active by default which will try to prevent untrusted code from executing.
  For example, a <a href="#root/_help_MgibgPcfeuGz">custom widget</a> needs the
  <code
  spellcheck="false">#widget</code> <a href="#root/_help_HI6GBBIduIgv">label</a> in order to function;
    safe import works by renaming that label to <code spellcheck="false">#disabled:widget</code>.</p>
<h2>Safe mode</h2>
<p>Sometimes active content can cause issues with the UI or the server, preventing
  it from functioning properly.&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_64ZTlUPgEPtW">Safe mode</a>&nbsp;allows
  starting Trilium in such a way that active content is not loaded by default
  at start-up, allowing the user to fix the problematic scripts or widgets.</p>
<h2>Types of active content</h2>
<p>These are the types of active content in Trilium, along with a few examples
  of what untrusted content of that type could cause:</p>

        that is not officially supported by Trilium.</td>
      <td>Can affect the UI similar to front-end scripts or custom widgets since
        the scripts are not completely encapsulated, or they can act similar to

<h2>Active content badge</h2>
<p>Starting with v0.102.0, on the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_IjZS7iK5EXtb">New Layout</a>&nbsp;a
  badge will be displayed near the note title, indicating that an active
  content is detected. Clicking the badge will reveal a menu with various
  options related to that content type, for example to open the documentation
  or to configure the execution of scripts.</p>
<p>For some active content types, such as backend scripts with custom triggering
  conditions a toggle button will appear. This makes it possible to easily
  disable scripts or widgets, but also to re-enable them if an import was
  made with safe mode active.</p>
