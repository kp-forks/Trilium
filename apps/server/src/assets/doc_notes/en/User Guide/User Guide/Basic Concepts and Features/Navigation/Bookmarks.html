<p>Frequently used notes can be bookmarked, which will make them appear in
  the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_xYmIYSP6wE3F">Launch Bar</a>&nbsp;for
  easy access.</p>
<h2>Configuring the launch bar</h2>
<p>If bookmarks don't appear in the launch bar, then most likely the bookmark
  section has been hidden. Go to the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_xYmIYSP6wE3F">Launch Bar</a>&nbsp;configuration
  from the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_x3i7MxGccDuM">Global menu</a>&nbsp;and
  ensure <em>Bookmarks</em> is in the <em>Visible Launchers</em> section.</p>
<h2>Bookmark folder</h2>
<p>Space in the left panel is limited, and you might want to bookmark many
  items. One possible solution is to bookmark a folder, so it shows its children:</p>
<p>To do this, bookmark a folder and assign it the <code spellcheck="false">#bookmarkFolder</code> label.</p>
<h2>Mobile</h2>
<p>On mobile, bookmarks are only displayed starting with v0.102.0. Because
  of the more constrained screen size, the bookmarks are grouped under a
  single icon instead of displaying them as separate icons.</p>
<p>When pressed, a menu will appear listing all the bookmarks. Bookmark folders
  are also supported and will appear as sub-menus.</p>
