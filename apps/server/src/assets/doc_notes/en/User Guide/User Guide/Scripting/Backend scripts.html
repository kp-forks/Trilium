<p>Unlike <a href="#root/_help_yIhgI5H7A2Sm">front-end scripts</a> which run on the
  client / browser-side, back-end scripts run directly on the Node.js environment
  of the Trilium server.</p>
<p>Back-end scripts can be used both on a&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_WOcw2SLH6tbX">Server Installation</a>&nbsp;(where it will run
  on the device the server is running on), or on the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_poXkQfguuA0U">Desktop Installation</a>&nbsp;(where it will
  run on the PC).</p>
<h2>Advantages of backend scripts</h2>
<p>The benefit of backend scripts is that they can be pretty powerful, for
  example to have access to the underlying system, for example it can read
  files or execute processes.</p>
<p>However, the main benefit of backend scripts is that they have easier
  access to the notes since the information about them is already loaded
  in memory. Whereas on the client, notes have to be manually loaded first.</p>
<h2>Creating a backend script</h2>
<p>Create a new&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_6f9hih2hXXZk">Code</a>&nbsp;note
  and select the language <em>JS backend</em>.</p>
<h2>Running backend scripts</h2>
<p>Backend scripts can be either run manually (via the Execute button on
  the script page), or they can be triggered on certain events.</p>
<p>In addition, scripts can be run automatically when the server starts up,
  on a fixed time interval or when a certain event occurs (such as an attribute
  being modified). For more information, see the dedicated&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_GPERMystNGTB">Events</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<h2>Script API</h2>
<p>Trilium exposes a set of APIs that can be directly consumed by scripts,
  under the <code spellcheck="false">api</code> object. For a reference of
  this API, see&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_MEtfsqa5VwNi">Backend API</a>.</p>
