  <figcaption>An example of a collection with a relatively large number of children

<p>The tree works well when the notes are structured in a hierarchy so that
  the number of items stays small. When a note has a large number of notes
  (in the order of thousands or tens of thousands), two problems arise:</p>
<ul>
  <li data-list-item-id="e536c86d371061c12f76f7de2a0af67be">Navigating between notes becomes cumbersome and the tree itself gets cluttered
    with a large amount of notes.</li>
  <li data-list-item-id="ecc37d6c4d0430254e98615842b94429d">The large amount of notes can slow down the application considerably.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since v0.102.0, Trilium allows the tree to hide the child notes of particular
  notes. This works for both&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/_help_GTwFsgaA0lCt">Collections</a>&nbsp;and
  normal notes.</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>When the subtree of a note is hidden, there are a few subtle changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li data-list-item-id="ec1ce3d2030f36e4847f3bbd9468d28e3">To indicate that the subtree is hidden, the note will not have an expand
    button and it will display the number of children to the right.</li>
  <li
  data-list-item-id="ea99d38ea6c8a816cf2ab7a7e73cfcac5">It's not possible to add a new note directly from the tree.
    <ul>
      <li data-list-item-id="ef0132a903a11e9f667b2b2f4c4fff17a">For&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/_help_GTwFsgaA0lCt">Collections</a>,
        it's best to use the built-in mechanism to create notes (for example by
        creating a new point on a geo-map, or by adding a new row in a table).</li>
      <li
      data-list-item-id="e7db44100046c8c79bf79841285aacd1f">For normal notes, it's still possible to create children via other means
        such as using the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/KSZ04uQ2D1St/iPIMuisry3hd/QEAPj01N5f7w/_help_hrZ1D00cLbal">Internal (reference) links</a>&nbsp;system.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li data-list-item-id="eb049f46cf91db6de113af1099a14944e">Notes can be dragged from outside the note, case in which they will be
      cloned into it.
      <ul>
        <li data-list-item-id="e96d9b7a0755e9c054bab5db4fc1aa25e">Instead of switching to the child notes that were copied, the parent note
          is highlighted instead.</li>
        <li data-list-item-id="ec667e3f94a0cfa3fa41ce38d3ed6ee95">A notification will indicate this behavior.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li data-list-item-id="eb64670dd7ace6764c18602b440f88049">Similarly, features such as cut/copy and then paste into the note will
      also work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Spotlighting</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right">
  <img style="aspect-ratio:322/83;" src="Hiding the subtree_image.png"
  width="322" height="83">
</figure>
<p>Even if the subtree of a note is hidden, if a child note manages to become
  active, it will still appear inside the tree in a special state called <em>spotlighted</em>.</p>
<p>During this state, the note remains under its normal hierarchy, so that
  its easy to tell its location. In addition, this means that:</p>
<ul>
  <li data-list-item-id="e2490369eb3d99ca694dba23a3410abef">The note position is clearly visible when using the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/gh7bpGYxajRS/wArbEsdSae6g/_help_eIg8jdvaoNNd">Search</a>.</li>
  <li
  data-list-item-id="e041d3807f80dc77b022540b0551b8376">The note can still be operated on from the tree, such as adding a&nbsp;
    <a
    class="reference-link" href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/gh7bpGYxajRS/BFs8mudNFgCS/IakOLONlIfGI/_help_TBwsyfadTA18">Branch prefix</a>&nbsp;or moving it outside the collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>The note appears in italics to indicate its temporary display. When switching
  to another note, the spotlighted note will disappear.</p>
<aside class="admonition note">
  <p>Only one note can be highlighted at the time. When working with multiple
    notes such as dragging them into the collection, no note will be spotlighted.
    This is intentional to avoid displaying a partial state of the subtree.</p>
</aside>
<h2>Working with collections</h2>
<p>By default, some of the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/_help_GTwFsgaA0lCt">Collections</a>&nbsp;will
  automatically hide their child notes, for example the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/GTwFsgaA0lCt/_help_CtBQqbwXDx1w">Kanban Board</a>&nbsp;or
  the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/GTwFsgaA0lCt/_help_2FvYrpmOXm29">Table</a>.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this is that collections are generally opaque to
  the rest of the notes and they can generate a large amount of sub-notes
  since they intentionally lack structure (in order to allow easy swapping
  between views).</p>
<p>Some types of collections have the child notes intentionally shown, for
  example the legacy ones (Grid and List), but also the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/GTwFsgaA0lCt/_help_zP3PMqaG71Ct">Presentation</a>&nbsp;which
  requires the tree structure in order to organize and edit the slides.</p>
<p>To toggle this behavior:</p>
<ul>
  <li data-list-item-id="e6d8c8c98802d70f13df626ea1f062122">In the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/gh7bpGYxajRS/Vc8PjrjAGuOp/_help_IjZS7iK5EXtb">New Layout</a>,
    press the Options button underneath the title and uncheck <em>Hide child notes in tree</em>.</li>
  <li
  data-list-item-id="e2398432e127c54239d679a6b13d8390b">Right click the collection note in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/gh7bpGYxajRS/Vc8PjrjAGuOp/_help_oPVyFC7WL2Lp">Note Tree</a>&nbsp;and
    select <em>Advanced</em> → <em>Show subtree</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Working with normal notes</h2>
<p>It's possible to hide the subtree for normal notes as well, not just collections.
  To do so, right click the note in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/gh7bpGYxajRS/Vc8PjrjAGuOp/_help_oPVyFC7WL2Lp">Note Tree</a>&nbsp;and
  select <em>Advanced</em> → <em>Hide subtree.</em>
